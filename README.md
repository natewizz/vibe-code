# vibe-code

**AI-powered development methodology for basic vibe coders who want to build working software fast.**

## The 3-Phase System

### üîç Phase 1: Contextify
- **Tool**: `contextify.html` - Interactive prompt generator
- **Purpose**: Turn rough ideas into structured AI prompts that get better responses

### üìã Phase 2: Documentify  
- **Purpose**: Test prompts across multiple AIs, organize project structure
- **Output**: Structured project ready for systematic building

### üíª Phase 3: The Grind
- **Files**: `rules.md`, `Build.md`, `TryAgain.md`
- **Purpose**: Build systematically with AI assistance methodologies

## Files

- **`rules.md`** - LLM instructions for basic vibe coder assistance (load into Cursor Rules)
- **`Build.md`** - Systematic feature development methodology (attach when building features)
- **`TryAgain.md`** - Deep debugging approach for persistent issues (attach when debugging)
- **`example.md`** - Demo project example for testing Contextify tool
- **`contextify.html`** - Interactive tool for generating structured AI prompts

## Quick Start

1. **Load `rules.md` into your Cursor Rules** for better baseline AI assistance
2. **Use `contextify.html`** to turn project ideas into structured prompts
3. **Attach `Build.md`** when asking AI to help build features
4. **Attach `TryAgain.md`** when debugging persistent issues

**Goal**: Transform from "AI helped me" to "AI actually built something useful" through better communication and systematic approaches.
